Miller-Rabin Algorithm

  The Miller-Rabin algorithm for primality test is implemented in C++. The Miller-Rabin algorithm is an efficient 
primality test is an efficient test to verify whether if the number is prime. It is based on the Fermatâ€™s little 
theorem in number theory. If you have a number to fit in 64-bit length block, you can use this script. Please use
the small witness number as much as possible to avoid any integer overflow.
